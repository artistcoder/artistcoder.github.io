 <h2>Study Update</h2>
 <h5>August 8, 2019</h5>
 <div class="post">
  <p class="post-indent">App Academy Outcome and Life Now </p>
  <br>
  <p class="post-indent">
    I got into App Academy, but I am not going to App Academy. The program was transparent about the 80+ hours/week required to be successful, and that isn't possible
    for me. I wanted it to be possible (see Pro/Con list!). However. Jesse works full time +, and our house needs to be managed (groceries/supplies/meals), and Henry needs me. 
    Turning down the admission was crushing, I felt the walls of the motherhood-room crushing me. What had been possible before was not possible anymore. Then, a nanny-share that I found on Next Door came through. 
    Then, I found App Academy offered their full syllabus online - for free. My original idea of going full-time back to school and learning a new skillset wasn't possible, but another variation was becoming apparent. We accepted the nanny share, 
    Henry is with a nanny M-Th from 9-5. During this time, I am studying App Academy Open. 
    We are on week 2 of this arrangment, and it is going so well. Henry likes the nanny, I am learning and I feel like me again.

    <p>YAY : Added github aliases to terminal</p>

 <h2>Coding Technical Interview</h2>
 <h5>May 28, 2019</h5>
 <div class="post">
  <p class="post-indent">App Academy Technical Interview </p>
  <br>
  <p class="post-indent">
    <p>I just completed the technical interview for App Academy. There were 3 questions, and after reading the prompt for the first question, my heartbeat took off on
      an elevated track. Reflecting on the experience, it felt <i>good</i>. I was able to finish the questions, and I talked through my approach (I am pretty sure I did, but I also tend
      to black out a bit mentally when my nerves get the best of me). The interviewer was kind and encouraging, which definitely helped my nerves settle...a  bit. I am eager to hear if I passed
      and get to the final stage (a non-technical interview). This experience will change my life; I am currently a stay at home mom (it has almost been a year since I have been in an office!!!),
      and I am not interested in returning to the career that I had before mom-dom. This opportunity will give me a marketable skillset, in a career where there is currently a high demand so I can 
      contribute to the financial support of our family. It is my one chance to make this change (mom --> career + mom), and I think the Pros outweigh the Cons. When Henry is older, and he looks at me,
      I want him to see an independent, sane and smart mom that he respects. It is entirely possible for kids to see this in their stay-at-home mom (RESPECT TO THE STAY AT HOME MOMS, YOU HEROES!!); but, I am
      not that great at the job. I need my own "thing" to keep me sane, and Henry needs a sane mom. 
    </p>
    
    <ul> <b>Pros</b>
      <li>Career Change</li>
      <li>Learning!</li>
      <li>Back to work</li>
      <li>Brain exercise</li>
      <li>A skillset that provides financial support to my family</li>
      <li>Sanity</li>
      <b>Cons</b>
      <li>Time away from Henry</li>
      <li>Intensity vs. my low self-confidence</li>
      <li>Food/Housework/life planning will be on hold</li>
      <li>Pressure on my marriage</li>

 <h2>Back At It</h2>
 <h5>April 29, 2019</h5>
 <div class="post">
  <p class="post-indent">Hello World, Again </p>
  <br>
  <p class="post-indent">
    Around mid-March, I <i>finally</i> was given an opportunity to interview at a company. My resume made it off
    the cutting room floor, and into the hands of a recruiter. The position was a bit of a stretch, but I did have relevant skills.
    The interview process took over my focus and time - prepping for interviews (compiling my experiences, and smart questions) and then
    I made it to the final round where I had to give a presentation. I do not like public speaking, and didn't have any material - so, practicing
    a presentation and creating a Keynote presentation took over my time (when Henry was napping). I was nervous and couldn't eat before the final interview, and after the
    interview I had an overwhelming amount of dread about the job. I would take it, to help our family financially, but I did not want to do it.
    I did not get the position, and now I am no longer applying to similar roles. I need to pursue a career that excites me - not one that fills me with dread. Seems obvious, but
    my prior career provided financial support that is difficult to leave. I am going to make the biggest leap, and risk, of my life so far and fully commit to learning to code. 
    So - hello again, here goes nothing.  </p>
